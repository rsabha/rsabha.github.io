<h1>Lord Nrsimha</h1>

<h5>TEXT 1</h5>
<p>
Narada Muni continued: All the sons of the demons appreciated the transcendental instructions of
Prahlada Maharaja and took them very seriously. They rejected the materialistic instructions given by
their teachers, Sanda and Amarka.
</p>

<h5>TEXT 2</h5>
<p>
When Sanda and Amarka, the sons of Sukracarya, observed that all the students, the sons of the
demons, were becoming advanced in Krsna consciousness because of the association of Prahlada
Maharaja, they were afraid. They approached the King of the demons and described the situation as it
was.
</p>

<h5>TEXTS 3-4</h5>
<p>
When Hiranyakasipu understood the entire situation, he was extremely angry, so much so that his body
trembled. Thus he finally decided to kill his son Prahlada. Hiranyakasipu was by nature very cruel, and
feeling insulted, he began hissing like a snake trampled upon by someone's foot. His son Prahlada was
peaceful, mild and gentle, his senses were under control, and he stood before Hiranyakasipu with folded
hands. According to Prahlada's age and behavior, he was not to be chastised. Yet with staring, crooked
eyes, Hiranyakasipu rebuked him with the following harsh words.
</p>

<h5>TEXT 5</h5>
<p>

Hiranyakasipu said: O most impudent, most unintelligent disruptor of the family, O lowest of mankind,
you have violated my power to rule you, and therefore you are an obstinate fool. Today I shall send you to
the place of Yamaraja.
</p>

<h5>TEXT 6</h5>
<p>

My son Prahlada, you rascal, you know that when I am angry all the planets of the three worlds tremble,
along with their chief rulers. By whose power has a rascal like you become so impudent that you appear
fearless and overstep my power to rule you?
</p>

<h5>TEXT 7</h5>
<p>
Prahlada Maharaja said: My dear King, the source of my strength, of which you are asking, is also the
source of yours. Indeed, the original source of all kinds of strength is one. He is not only your strength or
mine, but the only strength for everyone. Without Him, no one can get any strength. Whether moving or
not moving, superior or inferior, everyone, including Lord Brahma, is controlled by the strength of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead.
</p>

<h5>TEXT 8</h5>
<p>
The Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the supreme controller and time factor, is the power of the
senses, the power of the mind, the power of the body, and the vital force of the senses. His influence is
unlimited. He is the best of all living entities, the controller of the three modes of material nature. By His
own power, He creates this cosmic manifestation, maintains it and annihilates it also.
</p>

<h5>TEXT 9</h5>
<div class="supreme-personality-of-godhead"></div> 
<p>

Prahlada Maharaja continued: My dear father, please give up your demoniac mentality. Do not
discriminate in your heart between enemies and friends; make your mind equipoised toward everyone.
Except for the uncontrolled and misguided mind, there is no enemy within this world. When one sees
everyone on the platform of equality, one then comes to the position of worshiping the Lord perfectly.
</p>

<h5>TEXT 10</h5>
<p>
In former times there were many fools like you who did not conquer the six enemies that steal away the
wealth of the body. These fools were very proud, thinking, "I have conquered all enemies in all the ten
directions." But if a person is victorious over the six enemies and is equipoised toward all living entities,
for him there are no enemies. Enemies are merely imagined by one in ignorance.
</p>

<h5>TEXT 11</h5>
<p>
Hiranyakasipu replied: You rascal, you are trying to minimize my value, as if you were better than me at
controlling the senses. This is over-intelligent. I can therefore understand that you desire to die at my
hands, for this kind of nonsensical talk is indulged in by those about to die.
</p>

<h5>TEXT 12</h5>
<p>
O most unfortunate Prahlada, you have always described a supreme being other than me, a supreme
being who is above everything, who is the controller of everyone, and who is all-pervading. But where is
He? If He is everywhere, then why is He not present before me in this pillar?
</p>

<h5>TEXT 13</h5>
<p>
Because you are speaking so much nonsense, I shall now sever your head from your body. Now let me
see your most worshipable God come to protect you. I want to see it.
</p>

<h5>TEXT 14</h5>
<p>
Being obsessed with anger, Hiranyakasipu, who was very great in bodily strength, thus chastised his
exalted devotee-son Prahlada with harsh words. Cursing him again and again, Hiranyakasipu took up his
sword, got up from his royal throne, and with great anger struck his fist against the column.
</p>

<h5>TEXT 15</h5>
<p>

Then from within the pillar came a fearful sound, which appeared to crack the covering of the universe.
O my dear Yudhisthira, this sound reached even the abodes of the demigods like Lord Brahma, and when
the demigods heard it, they thought, "Oh, now our planets are being destroyed!"
</p>

<h5>TEXT 16</h5>
<p>
While showing his extraordinary prowess, Hiranyakasipu, who desired to kill his own son, heard that
wonderful, tumultuous sound, which had never before been heard. Upon hearing the sound, the other
leaders of the demons were afraid. None of them could find the origin of that sound in the assembly.
</p>

<h5>TEXT 17</h5>
<p>
To prove that the statement of His servant Prahlada Maharaja was substantial--in other words, to prove
that the Supreme Lord is present everywhere, even within the pillar of an assembly hall--the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, Hari, exhibited a wonderful form never before seen. The form was neither that of
a man nor that of a lion. Thus the Lord appeared in His wonderful form in the assembly hall.
</p>

<h5>TEXT 18</h5>
<p>
While Hiranyakasipu looked all around to find the source of the sound, that wonderful form of the
Lord, which could not be ascertained to be either a man or a lion, emerged from the pillar. In amazement,
Hiranyakasipu wondered, "What is this creature that is half man and half lion?"
</p>

<h5>TEXTS 19-22</h5>
<p>
Hiranyakasipu studied the form of the Lord, trying to decide who the form of Nrsimhadeva standing
before him was. The Lord's form was extremely fearsome because of His angry eyes, which resembled
molten gold; His shining mane, which expanded the dimensions of His fearful face; His deadly teeth; and
His razor-sharp tongue, which moved about like a dueling sword. His ears were erect and motionless, and
His nostrils and gaping mouth appeared like caves of a mountain. His jaws parted fearfully, and His entire
body touched the sky. His neck was very short and thick, His chest broad, His waist thin, and the hairs on
His body as white as the rays of the moon. His arms, which resembled flanks of soldiers, spread in all
directions as He killed the demons, rogues and atheists with His conchshell, disc, club, lotus and other
natural weapons.
</p>

<h5>TEXT 23</h5>
<p>
Hiranyakasipu murmured to himself, "Lord Visnu, who possesses great mystic power, has made this
plan to kill me, but what is the use of such an attempt? Who can fight with me?" Thinking like this and
taking up his club, Hiranyakasipu attacked the Lord like an elephant.
</p>

<h5>TEXT 24</h5>
<p>
Just as a small insect falls forcefully into a fire and the insignificant creature becomes invisible, when
Hiranyakasipu attacked the Lord, who was full of effulgence, Hiranyakasipu became invisible. This is not
at all astonishing, for the Lord is always situated in pure goodness. Formerly, during creation, He entered
the dark universe and illuminated it by His spiritual effulgence.
</p>

<h5>TEXT 25</h5>
<p>
Thereafter, the great demon Hiranyakasipu, who was extremely angry, swiftly attacked Nrsimhadeva
with his club and began to beat Him. Lord Nrsimhadeva, however, captured the great demon, along with
his club, just as Garuda might capture a great snake.
</p>

<h5>TEXT 26</h5>
<p>
O Yudhisthira, O great son of Bharata, when Lord Nrsimhadeva gave Hiranyakasipu a chance to slip
from His hand, just as Garuda sometimes plays with a snake and lets it slip from his mouth, the demigods,

who had lost their abodes and who were hiding behind the clouds for fear of the demon, did not consider
that incident very good. Indeed, they were perturbed.
</p>

<h5>TEXT 27</h5>
<p>
When Hiranyakasipu was freed from the hands of Nrsimhadeva, he falsely thought that the Lord was
afraid of his prowess. Therefore, after taking a little rest from the fight, he took up his sword and shield
and again attacked the Lord with great force.
</p>

<h5>TEXT 28</h5>
<p>
Making a loud, shrill sound of laughter, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Narayana, who is
extremely strong and powerful, captured Hiranyakasipu, who was protecting himself with his sword and
shield, leaving no gaps open. With the speed of a hawk, Hiranyakasipu moved sometimes in the sky and
sometimes on the earth, his eyes closed because of fear of Nrsimhadeva's laughter.
</p>

<h5>TEXT 29</h5>
<p>
As a snake captures a mouse or Garuda captures a very venomous snake, Lord Nrsimhadeva captured
Hiranyakasipu, who could not be pierced even by the thunderbolt of King Indra. As Hiranyakasipu moved
his limbs here, there and all around, very much afflicted at being captured, Lord Nrsimhadeva placed the
demon on His lap, supporting him with His thighs, and in the doorway of the assembly hall the Lord very
easily tore the demon to pieces with the nails of His hand.
</p>

<h5>TEXT 30</h5>
<p>
Lord Nrsimhadeva's mouth and mane were sprinkled with drops of blood, and His fierce eyes, full of
anger, were impossible to look at. Licking the edge of His mouth with His tongue, the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, Nrsimhadeva, decorated with a garland of intestines taken from Hiranyakasipu's
abdomen, resembled a lion that has just killed an elephant.
</p>

<h5>TEXT 31</h5>
<p>
The Supreme Personality of Godhead, who had many, many arms, first uprooted Hiranyakasipu's heart
and then threw him aside and turned toward the demon's soldiers. These soldiers had come in thousands
to fight with Him with raised weapons and were very faithful followers of Hiranyakasipu, but Lord
Nrsimhadeva killed all of them merely with the ends of His nails.

</p>

<h5>TEXT 32</h5>
<p>
The hair on Nrsimhadeva's head shook the clouds and scattered them here and there, His glaring eyes
stole the effulgence of the luminaries in the sky, and His breathing agitated the seas and oceans. Because
of His roaring, all the elephants in the world began to cry in fear.
</p>

<h5>TEXT 33</h5>
<p>
Airplanes were thrown into outer space and the upper planetary system by the hair on Nrsimhadeva's
head. Because of the pressure of the Lord's lotus feet, the earth appeared to slip from its position, and all
the hills and mountains sprang up due to His intolerable force. Because of the Lord's bodily effulgence,
both the sky and all directions diminished in their natural illumination.
</p>

<h5>TEXT 34</h5>
<p>
Manifesting a full effulgence and a fearsome countenance, Lord Nrsimha, being very angry and finding
no contestant to face His power and opulence, then sat down in the assembly hall on the excellent throne
of the king. Because of fear and obedience, no one could come forward to serve the Lord directly.
</p>

<h5>TEXT 35</h5>
<p>
Hiranyakasipu had been exactly like a fever of meningitis in the head of the three worlds. Thus when
the wives of the demigods in the heavenly planets saw that the great demon had been killed by the
personal hands of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, their faces blossomed in great joy. The wives of
the demigods again and again showered flowers from heaven upon Lord Nrsimhadeva like rain.
</p>

<h5>TEXT 36</h5>
<p>
At that time, the airplanes of the demigods, who desired to see the activities of the Supreme Lord,
Narayana, crowded the sky. The demigods began beating drums and kettledrums, and upon hearing them
the angelic women began to dance, while the chiefs of the Gandharvas sang sweetly.
</p>

<h5>TEXTS 37-39</h5>
<p>

My dear King Yudhisthira, the demigods then approached the Lord. They were headed by Lord Brahma,
King Indra and Lord Siva and included great saintly persons and the residents of Pitrloka, Siddhaloka,
Vidyadhara-loka and the planet of the snakes. The Manus approached, and so did the chiefs of various
other planets. The angelic dancers approached, as did the Gandharvas, the Caranas, the Yaksas, the
inhabitants of Kinnaraloka, the Vetalas, the inhabitants of Kimpurusa-loka, and the personal servants of
Visnu like Sunanda and Kumuda. All of them came near the Lord, who glowed with intense light. They
individually offered their obeisances and prayers, their hands folded at their heads.
</p>

<h5>TEXT 40</h5>
<p>
Lord Brahma prayed: My Lord, You are unlimited, and You possess unending potencies. No one can
estimate or calculate Your prowess and wonderful influence, for Your actions are never polluted by the
material energy. Through the material qualities, You very easily create the universe, maintain it and again
annihilate it, yet You remain the same, without deterioration. I therefore offer my respectful obeisances
unto You.
</p>

<h5>TEXT 41</h5>
<p>
Lord Siva said: The end of the millennium is the time for Your anger. Now that this insignificant demon
Hiranyakasipu has been killed, O my Lord, who are naturally affectionate to Your devotee, kindly protect
his son Prahlada Maharaja, who is standing nearby as Your fully surrendered devotee.
</p>

<h5>TEXT 42</h5>
<p>
King Indra said: O Supreme Lord, You are our deliverer and protector. Our shares of sacrifices, which
are actually Yours, have been recovered from the demon by You. Because the demoniac king
Hiranyakasipu was most fearsome, our hearts, which are Your permanent abode, were all overtaken by
him. Now, by Your presence, the gloom and darkness in our hearts have been dissipated. O Lord, for
those who always engage in Your service, which is more exalted than liberation, all material opulence is
insignificant. They do not even care for liberation, not to speak of the benefits of kama, artha and dharma.
</p>

<h5>TEXT 43</h5>
<p>
All the saintly persons present offered their prayers in this way: O Lord, O supreme maintainer of those
sheltered at Your lotus feet, O original Personality of Godhead, the process of austerity and penance, in
which You instructed us before, is the spiritual power of Your very self. It is by austerity that You create
the material world, which lies dormant within You. This austerity was almost stopped by the activities of
this demon, but now, by Yourself appearing in the form of Nrsimhadeva, which is meant just to give us
protection, and by killing this demon, You have again approved the process of austerity.
</p>

<h5>TEXT 44</h5>
<p>
The inhabitants of Pitrloka prayed: Let us offer our respectful obeisances unto Lord Nrsimhadeva, the
maintainer of the religious principles of the universe. He has killed Hiranyakasipu, the demon who by
force enjoyed all the offerings of the sraddha ceremonies performed by our sons and grandsons on the
anniversaries of our death and who drank the water with sesame seeds offered in holy places of

pilgrimage. By killing this demon, O Lord, You have taken back all this stolen property from his abdomen
by piercing it with Your nails. We therefore wish to offer our respectful obeisances unto You.
</p>

<h5>TEXT 45</h5>
<p>
The inhabitants of Siddhaloka prayed: O Lord Nrsimhadeva, because we belong to Siddhaloka, we
automatically achieve perfection in all eight kinds of mystic power. Yet Hiranyakasipu was so dishonest
that by the strength of his power and austerity, he took away our powers. Thus he became very proud of
his mystic strength. Now, because this rogue has been killed by Your nails, we offer our respectful
obeisances unto You.
</p>

<h5>TEXT 46</h5>
<p>
The inhabitants of Vidyadhara-loka prayed: Our acquired power to appear and disappear in various
ways according to varieties of meditation was banned by that foolish Hiranyakasipu because of his pride
in his superior bodily strength and his ability to conquer others. Now the Supreme Personality of
Godhead has killed him just as if the demon were an animal. Unto that supreme pastime form of Lord
Nrsimhadeva, we eternally offer our respectful obeisances.
</p>

<h5>TEXT 47</h5>
<p>
The inhabitants of Nagaloka said: The most sinful Hiranyakasipu took away all the jewels on our hoods
and all our beautiful wives. Now, since his chest has been pierced by Your nails, You are the source of all
pleasure to our wives. Thus we together offer our respectful obeisances unto You.
</p>

<h5>TEXT 48</h5>
<p>
All the Manus offered their prayers as follows: As Your order carriers, O Lord, we, the Manus, are the
law-givers for human society, but because of the temporary supremacy of this great demon,
Hiranyakasipu, our laws for maintaining varnasrama-dharma were destroyed. O Lord, now that You have
killed this great demon, we are in our normal condition. Kindly order us, Your eternal servants, what to
do now.
</p>

<h5>TEXT 49</h5>
<p>
The prajapatis offered their prayers as follows: O Supreme Lord, Lord of even Brahma and Siva, we, the
prajapatis, were created by You to execute Your orders, but we were forbidden by Hiranyakasipu to create
any more good progeny. Now the demon is lying dead before us, his chest pierced by You. Let us
therefore offer our respectful obeisances unto You, whose incarnation in this form of pure goodness is
meant for the welfare of the entire universe.
</p>

<h5>TEXT 50</h5>
<p>
The inhabitants of Gandharvaloka prayed: Your Lordship, we ever engage in Your service by dancing
and singing in dramatic performances, but this Hiranyakasipu, by the influence of his bodily strength and
valor, brought us under his subjugation. Now he has been brought to this low condition by Your
Lordship. What benefit can result from the activities of such an upstart as Hiranyakasipu?

</p>

<h5>TEXT 51</h5>
<p>
The inhabitants of the Carana planet said: O Lord, because You have destroyed the demon
Hiranyakasipu, who was always a stake in the hearts of all honest men, we are now relieved, and we
eternally take shelter of Your lotus feet, which award the conditioned soul liberation from materialistic
contamination.
</p>

<h5>TEXT 52</h5>
<p>
The inhabitants of Yaksaloka prayed: O controller of the twenty-four elements, we are considered the
best servants of Your Lordship because of rendering services pleasing to You, yet we engaged as palanquin
carriers by the order of Hiranyakasipu, the son of Diti. O Lord in the form of Nrsimhadeva, You know
how this demon gave trouble to everyone, but now You have killed him, and his body is mixing with the
five material elements.
</p>

<h5>TEXT 53</h5>
<p>
The inhabitants of Kimpurusa-loka said: We are insignificant living entities, and You are the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, the supreme controller. Therefore how can we offer suitable prayers unto You?
When this demon was condemned by devotees because they were disgusted with him, he was then killed
by You.
</p>

<h5>TEXT 54</h5>
<p>
The inhabitants of Vaitalika-loka said: Dear Lord, because of chanting Your spotless glories in great
assemblies and arenas of sacrifice, we were accustomed to great respect from everyone. This demon,
however, usurped that position. Now, to our great fortune, You have killed this great demon, exactly as
one cures a chronic disease.
</p>

<h5>TEXT 55</h5>
<p>
The Kinnaras said: O supreme controller, we are ever-existing servants of Your Lordship, but instead of
rendering service to You, we were engaged by this demon in his service, constantly and without
remuneration. This sinful man has now been killed by You. Therefore, O Lord Nrsimhadeva, our master,
we offer our respectful obeisances unto You. Please continue to be our patron.
</p>

<h5>TEXT 56</h5>
<p>
The associates of Lord Visnu in Vaikuntha offered this prayer: O Lord, our supreme giver of shelter,
today we have seen Your wonderful form as Lord Nrsimhadeva, meant for the good fortune of all the
world. O Lord, we can understand that Hiranyakasipu was the same Jaya who engaged in Your service but
was cursed by brahmanas and who thus received the body of a demon. We understand that his having
now been killed is Your special mercy upon him.
